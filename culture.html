                Sneakers' origins lie outside of fashion, in the world of sports.
                Their transcendence from sports to fashion is not the only jump they have made between cultural realms though.
                Sneakers have gone on to touch the music industry, the film and television industry, and they have even dabbled a bit in the culinary realm.

            <h2>Sports</h2>
                <p>
                    With sneakers taking their origins in athletics, it comes as no surprise that many famous athletes have their own lines and collections of sneakers.
                    Michael Jordan teamed up with Nike to create Air Jordan, and many other basketball all-stars have also associated their name with sneakers.
                    While the classic Air Jordan 1 is typically no longer used for basketball, Air Jordan has evolved into its own sub-brand of Nike, producing many other clothes and shoes for all types of purposes.
                    Nike currently makes basketball shoes in association with the late Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Paul George, Russell Westbrook, and Zion Williamson.
                    Nike isn't the only company capitalizing on professional atheletes and their sneakers though, as basketball player Stephen Curry has his own collection of shoes with Under Armour.

            <h2>Music</h2>
                <p>
                    Sneakers have undoubtedly influenced the music industry, especially hip hop.
                    In the mid-1980s, rap group Run-DMC signed an endorsement deal with Adidas after an Adidas executive recognized the marketing opportunity upon seeing the group's influence over their fans wearing Adidas tracksuits and Adidas Superstar sneakers.
                    Nike Air Force 1 sneakers also culminated a relationship with hip hop music over the years.

                    Fast forward to the present day, and artists who made their name in the music industry now have the opportunity to actually design and create sneakers of their own.
                    A prime example of this is Kanye West with the collections he made for Nike and Louis Vuitton before having his own line with Adidas.
                    Interestingly enough, sneakers have even become a sort of point of contention between artists like Kanye West and Drake.
                    Kanye's brand, Yeezy, is associated with Adidas, whereas Drake is a long-time fan and collaborator of Nike.
                    The Nike vs. Adidas battle has culminated itself within modern hip-hop between these 2 artists in songs like Facts by Kanye West in which he boasts about his success with Adidas over Nike, and SICKO MODE by Travis Scott featuring Drake where Drake drops lines like, "checks over stripes".
                    Travis Scott, Pharrell Williams, Tyler the Creator, Kendrick Lamar, and many more have also dipped into the sneaker world.

                <p>
                    Sneakers have also served as a creative muse for artists with songs like "High Top Versaces" by 2 Chainz featuring Young Thug, "Nikes" by Frank Ocean, and many, many more.

            <h2>Film & Television</h2>
                <p>
                    Sneakers have a presence in the film and television industry as well.
                    In the film Back to the Future Part II (1989), a sneaker called the 'Nike MAG' with a self-lacing function was featured. 
                    In 2011, the Nike MAG was actually produced and released for sale in a limited quantity, and again in 2016. 
                    In early 2019, Adidas teamed up with HBO's Game Of Thrones televesion series to co-create 6 designs for Adidas's Ultra Boost sneakers.

            <h2>Foodstuff</h2>
                <p>
                    Sneakers and food, both cultural pillars on their own, often come together in fantastic ways.
                    One of those ways being food-themed sneakers, such as Nike's SB Dunk 'Chicken and Waffles' (2016) and Nike's SB Dunk Low 'Ben & Jerry's Chunky Dunky' (2020).
                    The Chunky Dunks featured an ice-cream pint-shaped box.

                        Another intersection of sneakers and foods is the sneaker store 'Cookies N' Kicks' on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles.
                        This stores buys, sells, and trades premium streetwear sneakers and other various clothing items and collectibles. 
                        The kick is (no pun intended) that every customer is warmly welcomed with a delicious cookie
