                Street fashion, aka streetwear, is fashion that did not emerge from major studios or designers, but rather evolved from "the streets", or common consumers. 
                Although, today, with the growing popularity of street fashion, the lines between streeth fashion and luxury design have begun to blur.
                Street brands that have gained popularity have grown into what can be considered major luxury design labels, such as Off-White.
                Major design labels have started to recruit designers who focus on street fashion. For example, in 2018 Louis Vuitton hired the late Virgil Abloh, creator of Off-White, as the artistic director of menswear.
                Brands that did not initially solely produce in the name of fashion/design have collaborated with designers/artists for special product releases. Nike, Adidas, and Converse are all examples of everyday brands that have done this.
                The following are some examples of modern streetwear sneakers.
